                                 <p>I'm a new freshman in this Tech field. I enjoy coding because I find it much easy to relate and logical than any other thing learnt so far. Every correct output brings a big smile on my face and every error tells that there is still scope to learn more. Apart from learning to code, I also spend my time in my side hustle of writing my online book named"My IAS Husband". It had received over 8.2K+ views on Wattpad so far and still counting. I'm all time eager to learn new things and always present to gain new experiences.</p>
